Hi!

This is Hugh(the intern)'s first project at unboxed so go easy on me :)

## How to run

cd into the directory of this readme and type ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies and then run it by typing ```npm start```

## Current status of project

This project is now fully working, it can read a json file and output the points/polygons onto the map (provided the formatting is correct) and follows the GDS (GOV.UK Design System). It is currently in the process of getting a JSON from the api and parsing the information to display.
