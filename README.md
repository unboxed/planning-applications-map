Hi!

This is Hugh(the intern)'s first project at unboxed so go easy on me :)

## How to run

cd into the directory of this readme and type ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies and then run it by typing ```npm start```

## Current status of project

This project is now fully working, it can read a json file and output the points/polygons onto the map (provided the formatting is correct) and follows the GDS (GOV.UK Design System). It currently uses GET from running a local cors-anywhere server which you can set up [here](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere#demo-server).
