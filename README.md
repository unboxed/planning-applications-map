Hi!

This is Hugh(the intern)'s first project at unboxed so go easy on me :)

For now I have just uploaded a basic React app so don't have much to say here, will update as I go

## How to run

cd into the directory of this readme and type ```npm install``` to install dependencies and then run it by typing ```npm start```

## Current status of project

This project is now fully working, it can read a json file and output the points/polygons onto the map (provided the formatting is correct) and follows the GDS (GOV.UK Design System). It currently only reads the json locally, but this can be easily implemented when ready.
