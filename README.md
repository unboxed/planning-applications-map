Hi!

This is Hugh(the intern)'s first project at unboxed so go easy on me :)

## How to run

cd into the directory of this readme and type ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies and then run it by typing ```npm start```

## Current status of project

This project is now fully working, it can read a json file and output the points/polygons onto the map (provided the formatting is correct) and follows the GDS (GOV.UK Design System). It currently uses GET from the demo server on https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://southwark.bops-staging.services so if you are running locally you may have to go to this site and click the button for temporary access.
