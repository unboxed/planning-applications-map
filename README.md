Hi!

This is Hugh(the intern)'s first project at unboxed so go easy on me :)

For now I have just uploaded a basic React app so don't have much to say here, will update as I go

## How to run

cd into the directory of this readme and type 'npm start'

## Other notes

I am temporarily including a JSON file to practice the action of reading it and displaying the information, so the code will rely on the formatting of the file for the time being hence it being included. It will follow GeoJSON format
